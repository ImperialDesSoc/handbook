Support for Academic Transition
===============================

Students who join Imperial are all academically able, but they come from a wide range of secondary education cultures. Adjusting to the challenge of higher education can be tough, and we offer some special resources to support you.

First and foremost, please take time to explore the new Imperial Success Guide site. This was put together from a vast amount of collective experience — above all that of many students who were asked what was needed to empower and support them as they started university. The guide brings together information on effective study, assessments and feedback, wellbeing, workshops and support to ensure that you know where to look for advice and guidance on study skills.

English Classes
===============

The undergraduate course involves a substantial amount of reading and writing, as well as oral presentations. Fluency in English is vital if you are to be successful in the course. The Centre for Academic English runs a series of English classes in the evenings for students who need tuition and practice.

Disability Advisory Service
===========================

The School Disability Liaison Officer (Andy Brand andrew.brand@imperial.ac.uk) can provide advice, support and referral to the College-wide Disability Advisory Service.

The Disability Advisory Service works with individual students, no matter what their disability, to ensure that they have the support they need. It can also help if you think that you may have a previously unrecognised study problem such as dyslexia. The service is both confidential (information about you is only passed on to other people in the university with your agreement) and individual in that any support is tailored to what you need.

**Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)** If you are classified as a Home student for fees and have a disability you can apply for a grant called the Disabled Students Allowance, which can pay any extra costs that are a direct result of disability. This fund is not means-tested and is also a grant not a loan so any home student with a disability can apply and will not be expected to pay it back.

Evening Classes
===============

The Centre for Co-curricular Studies offers evening classes in a broad selection of subjects outside science and technology, such as languages and humanities. Fees are normally due, but these will be considerably less than the equivalent classes from a private company.

Central Library
===============

The College’s Central Library is next to the Sherfield Building. It provides access to high quality resources including electronic journals, databases, textbooks, print journals and maps. PCs and wireless access to the College computing network are also available.

Much more information is available on the library’s website, and you will be given an induction course during the first week of term. Like every other department, we have a School Librarian to guide and support your access to central library resources.

The School librarian maintains a web page with a blog. They also have office hours for consultation (see the web page for details).

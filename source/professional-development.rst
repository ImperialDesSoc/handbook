Professional Development

What is a Chartered Engineer?
=============================

The title Chartered Engineer (CEng) is protected by UK civil law and is internationally one of the most widely recognised of engineering qualifications. In the UK, it is awarded by the Engineering Council.

The benchmark for CEng is UK-SPEC: the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence. UK-SPEC, published by the Engineering Council, tries to specify the essential attributes of a professional engineer. It was developed, and is regularly updated, by panels representing UK professional engineering institutions, employers and educators.

To become a Chartered Engineer, you will need:

- The Educational Base: an MEng or equivalent degree from a recognised degree programme like ours; and
- An extended period of Initial Professional Development (IPD): work- based training and/or experience under the guidance of a Mentor.

A professional institution like the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED) or the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), acts as an agent for the Engineering Council: it both accredits degree programmes and, through a network of suitably qualified mentors, monitors the subsequent IPD process.

UROP Placements
===============

The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP) matches students with ‘research internships’, either within or outside Imperial. A UROP placement offers work experience within a research environment; the work is usually paid and some bursaries are available.

The UROP scheme at Imperial is coordinated within Registry, and is described in detail on the College web page. However, perhaps the best way to initiate a placement within Imperial will be to contact a research-active staff member whose work interests you. If you do agree a placement by this informal route it should still be set up formally, otherwise you will be unable to earn ECTS credits.

Most UROP placements are paid, but not all supervisors have sufficient research funding available. Some research sponsors, even relatively generous ones, put tight restrictions on the way in which funds can be spent. Under these conditions supervisors may be able to offer exciting projects bringing close interaction with potential employers, but unable to support bursaries for them.

Careers Service Sessions
========================

Throughout all four years of your course you will have the opportunity to engage with careers sessions to prepare you for future employment and opportunities

These careers sessions will be scheduled into you timetable and it will be clear whether they are optional (drop-in or pre-book) or compulsory.

School’s Careers Officer
------------------------

The School’s Careers officer is Dr. Talya Porat. If you have any queries or suggestions about careers events, you can email them at: t.porat@imperial.ac.uk

College Career Services
-----------------------

There is a central College Careers Centre based on the 5th Floor of the Sherfield Building.

Full details of their services can be found on their webpage.

Intellectual Property
=====================

What is IP?
-----------

Intellectual Property (IP) is a term used to describe an individual’s creative output such as an invention. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) such as trademarks, patents, copyright and design rights are the legal means that can be used to prevent others from using your creative output without your consent.

You need to consider protecting any IP you develop whilst you are at The School, whether you have developed it as part of the School’s syllabus or through extra-curricular activities.

IP will be covered during the MEng curriculum however you should start learning the basics now. The College has some excellent resources to teach you about IP on the Imperial College website.

The College have also created two YouTube videos which also recommended viewing.

Industry Advisory Arrangements
==============================

The School has a strategy for industrial engagement to ensure that the vision of the school, the directions of research and the development of the curriculum are pushing the boundaries of theory and practice in design and engineering.

To address this, our engagement with industrial partners spans three levels:

- **Strategic Advisory Board (SAB)**

  This is an elite group of up to 10 companies at a time, carefully selected to give a strategic overview of global future trends that will impact design engineering.

  We have selected world-leading companies from a range of different industrial sectors and contexts, across physical and digital domains.

  We work closely with these companies to help us gain foresight of how global and local economies will change, and what big shifts are on the horizon.

- **Industry Advisory Board (IAB)**

  This is a broader group of up to 30 members at a time. These are invited to represent a wider cross section of industry (from small start-ups to large international corporations across different disciplines) and the third sector (policy and charities) to give us insight into a wider range of opportunities.

- **Industrial Partnerships Group (IPG)**

  This final level consists of any organisations linked to the school, including those who offer industrial placements, work on research projects, or run projects with our students.

  They receive newsletters about the work in the school and we track partnerships across different activities to ensure linked working across the school. We host a range of engagement activities with these different groups across the year, and invite students to participate in discussions, networking and showcasing their work.

Joining Professional Institutions
=================================

In October 2017 the IED (Institution of Engineering Designers) granted accreditation to the MEng in Design Engineering. This is a tremendous achievement and endorsement of the programme.

The School is also seeking accreditation from IET and IMechE and we are on track for this to be awarded in Summer 2019 (after our first intake graduate).

We strongly encourage you to make use of student membership for these three institutions: there are very low (IET) or no membership fees (IMechE and IED) until you graduate.

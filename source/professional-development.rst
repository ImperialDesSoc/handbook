What is a Chartered Engineer?
=============================

.. todo:: add contextual links into these paragraphs

The title Chartered Engineer (CEng) is protected by UK civil law and is internationally one of the most widely recognised of engineering qualifications. In the UK, it is awarded by the Engineering Council.

The benchmark for CEng is UK-SPEC: the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence. UK-SPEC, published by the Engineering Council, tries to specify the essential attributes of a professional engineer. It was developed, and is regularly updated, by panels representing UK professional engineering institutions, employers and educators.

To become a Chartered Engineer, you will need:

- The Educational Base: an MEng or equivalent degree from a recognised degree programme like ours; and
- An extended period of Initial Professional Development (IPD): work- based training and/or experience under the guidance of a Mentor.

A professional institution like the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED) or the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), acts as an agent for the Engineering Council: it both accredits degree programmes and, through a network of suitably qualified mentors, monitors the subsequent IPD process.

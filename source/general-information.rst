Out of Hours Service
--------------------

If you are registered with the Health Centre as a National Health Service (NHS) patient, and need medical advice outside normal opening hours please telephone the surgery as usual. Follow the recorded instructions which explain how to contact its out-of-hours service.

The Health Centre provides a 24-hour emergency service for its NHS registered patients only.

If you are not eligible to register there, you may use its onsite services during normal working hours only. Make sure you are registered with an NHS General Practitioner near where you live during term, in case you need the doctor to visit you there or need medical advice out-of-hours.

Mental health services
======================

Mental Health issues are not uncommon and 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a `mental health problem each year`_.

.. todo:: The source for the reference above will be added.

If you find that you are struggling to cope with **any** aspect of your life, it is better to seek help earlier rather than later.

Short-term counselling is offered to all registered students of Imperial College London. It is free and confidential:

  </div>

The above website also includes links to various resources that provide mental health information and advice.

If you are registered as an NHS patient you are also able to access free Mental Health services via the NHS although waiting times can be long.

.. important::
  If you are feeling suicidal it is very important for you to talk to someone and tell them how you are feeling. This could be a family member, a friend, a member of College staff, a health professional, a helpline or whoever you feel comfortable talking to.

  **If you are considering killing yourself right now you should contact the emergency services (999) immediately.**

Security
========

Imperial is a relatively public space, and, sadly, thefts do occur from time to time. It is essential to look after your own property and to remain vigilant. Take great care of both your personal property and that of the College.

If you are planning to use a bicycle in London, please be careful and lock it securely. You can find more information about this at the link below.

.. important::
  If you lose anything, report it promptly to the security officer in Sherfield building (no. 20 on :ref:`campus map <appendix-map>`, internal tel. 4444). It is especially important to report a lost or stolen id card. If you find an ID card or any apparently lost property in the school, please hand it into the undergraduate office or postgraduate office.

Your ID Card
============

The College-wide security system of ID swipe cards controls and monitors access to halls of residence, and to the School building and certain rooms outside normal hours. Your ID card will be your passport for the duration of your course: get it as soon as you can, and treat it with respect.

.. important:: Lending your swipe card to friends or acquaintances, even for a short time, is a serious offence which can result in your being asked to leave the College

Student Disciplinary Procedure
==============================

The College has the right to investigate any allegation of misconduct against a student and may take disciplinary action where it decides, on the balance of probabilities, that a breach of discipline has been committed. The general principles of the Student Disciplinary Procedure are available on the College website.

Smoke-Free Policy
=================

.. image:: _static/smoke-free.jpg

All Imperial campuses and properties are smoke-free. This means that smoking by staff and students is not permitted on or within 20 metres of College land. The policy covers all College properties, including student accommodation and sports grounds.

  </div>

Health and Safety
=================

Design engineers make things, test things and deal with potentially dangerous quantities, e.g. chemicals, power, energy, force, pressure, mass and velocity.

To be a professional engineer your consciousness of risk, and concern for your own and others’ safety, must be considered and instinctive. We will emphasise this from day one. Very soon after registration, every student must attend the School Safety Briefing.

You are responsible for looking after your own health and safety and that of others affected by your College-related work and leisure activities. You must:

- comply with all local and College policies, procedures and codes of practice and with the arrangements which the College has in place to control health and safety risks.

- ensure that your activities do not present unnecessary or uncontrolled risks to yourself or to others.

- attend appropriate induction and training.

- report any accidents, unsafe circumstances or work-related ill health of which you become aware to the appropriate person.

- not interfere with any equipment provided for Health and Safety.

- inform your supervisor or the person in charge of the activity in cases where you are not confident that you are competent to carry out a work or leisure activity safely, rather than compromise your own safety or the safety of others.

  </div>

The School's safety contact is the :ref:`safety-officer`.

.. important::
  The College is required, under the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974), to formally acquaint all its members with their legal responsibilities for the maintenance of their own safety and that of others. You must read and understand the linked Health and Safety Policy Statement, and will be required to sign a form to say that you have.

  Failure to attend the Safety Briefing will forfeit the protection offered by the Act and render you vulnerable to personal prosecution in the courts. In any event, you will certainly not be allowed to work in the School workshops and laboratories.

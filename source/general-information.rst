Health Services
===============

A list of College health and welfare services is posted throughout the School and College. You will probably need to make little or no use of these services, but you should register as an NHS patient with the Health Centre within the first few weeks of term.

Health Centre
-------------

The College has its own Health Centre that is only for Imperial Staff and Students. This is run by the National Health Service (NHS).

**Registration**

On the Sunday before Welcome Week, the Health Centre will be open for students in local halls of Residence to register, and to provide information on vaccinations if required. Health centre staff will also be working late sessions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of Welcome Week for new registrations and immunisations.

Clubs and Societies
===================

This is a demanding course and we expect you to work hard; but we hope you will ‘play hard’ as well. Opportunities range from the hundreds of student societies to the social and cultural resources of one of the world’s greatest cities.

Since there are over 8000 undergraduate students at Imperial, it is virtually certain that your interests however unusual - will be shared by others. The clubs and societies formed by students and supported by Union funding will be competing to attract new members at the Union Fair on the first Tuesday of autumn term. More than 300 societies are affiliated to the Student Union, and every one of them will want you to join.

London offers an incredible range of entertainment and culture, both nearby and further afield. The substantial price reductions available to students make this expensive place extremely good value.

Take advantage of being here: few of you will have a second chance of university education.

.. warning:: Be selective — don’t fall into the trap of trying to do too many things! There are only 168 hours in every week.

College Support and Welfare
===========================

Coming to Imperial can be quite daunting if you are moving away from home for the first time — especially if you are also new to this country. The College is probably bigger than any institution you’ve attended before, and the freedom of life in it is immense. The culture shock can be a challenge, but there are resources at both School and College level to help you face it.

A single website (link at the end of this section) now coordinates access to the entire range of support and welfare services offered by the College and the Students’ Union.

The main areas covered are:

- Academic appeals and regulations
- Careers Advisory Service
- Chaplaincy
- College Hardship/Access to Learning Funds
- College Tutors
- Director of Student Affairs
- Disability Advisory Service
- English language support
- Equality
- Health Centre
- ICU Advice Centre
- ICU student representation
- International student support
- Maths support (METRIC)
- NHS Dentist Student
- Counselling Service
- Wardens

ICU Advice Centre
=================

.. image:: advice-centre.jpg

Imperial College Union runs the Advice Centre independently of the College with advisers on hand to provide free, confidential, independent advice on a wide range of welfare issues including housing, money and debt, employment and consumer rights, and personal safety.

The Advice centre is your first port of call if you are experiencing difficulties during your time at university. Their advice is:

- **Free**: you don’t have to pay to get advice

- **Confidential**: they won’t tell anyone that you’ve gone to see them and they won’t share with anyone else what you tell them unless in exceptional circumstances (see their confidentiality policy on their website, below.)

- **Impartial**: they offer the advice that is best for you, they are not influenced by any other organisation

- **Independent**: They are not part of the Imperial College so their advice is not influenced by The College or School.

- **Non-judgemental**: as long as you are a student they will offer the best advice they can give you and they will not judge your position or the next step you decide to take.

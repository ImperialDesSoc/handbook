I need some lockable storage. Do we have any?
*********************************************

An email was sent out to all undergraduates to canvas any requests for lockable storage. Unfortunately, more requests than available lockers were made, so we did our best to ensure that they were assigned to students with valid reasons for needing lockable storage.

Remember that project work, gym/sport kit, etc. can all be stored in the cardboard boxes in the Level 2 Studio.

Who are my reps?
****************

There is now a notice board in the Level 2 Studio (by the west staircase) that shows the names and pictures of all the reps. You can also find them in this handbook: :doc:`reps`.

Aren't some of the Level 1 (Library) plug sockets not working?
**************************************************************

None of the sockets on the north side of the building are working due to the building works on the ground floor. These will be back online when works are completed.

Aren't some of the Level 2 plug sockets and radiators not working?
******************************************************************

There were a couple plugs not working due to a circuit being tripped by contractors. This has been fixed. If you find any more items malfunctioning in the Dyson Building, please send an email to Sam McKenney.

The radiators were not functioning for a short while but this should also be rectified now.

When are the Level 1 Library / Level 2 Studio / Level 3 Studio booked?
**********************************************************************

Each entrance to each of the three floors now has a published paper timetable available to see when the room is available to use. To view this timetable, or future dates, please see the following links:

Do students have access to the Dyson Building on the weekend?
*************************************************************

All undergraduates have access to normal working space in the Dyson Building from 7am to 10pm all 7 days of the week.

Shouldn't DE3 fees be lower due to placement?
*********************************************

Official response explained that there is an enormous effort that goes into arranging the placements, carrying out visits, assessing the work (including during the summer), running in-house placements for life-boat emergency situations. All this work is no less demanding then the work required for modules in the Summer term!

Can students get the Sketch UX software for free?
*************************************************

You may have noticed that the pricing on `Sketchapp.com <https://www.sketchapp.com/pricing/>`_ states institutions can get the app for free. This is true, but unfortunately this only applies to College owned computers. If you want to get a copy of Sketch for your personal laptop, the 50% discount will have to suffice.

==================
Surveys & Feedback
==================

We welcome feedback on teaching from students. We want to improve and make your learning experiences in the department as enjoyable and fulfilling as possible.

Students have academic tutors and personal tutors who can help resolve problems and pass on suggestions for improvement in teaching. All students are encouraged to raise issues and to make suggestions to the School.

There are a number of avenues of feedback available to our students.

Giving feedback to staff
========================

Please feel free to give courteous feedback and raise questions in-person to all staff. If you have an issue and don’t speak up, then the School will not be able to address the matter in a timely manner.

Module Leaders
--------------

You can contact the relevant Module Leader or Associate Module Leaders with general points about a module at anytime. This includes comments on the general content of courses as well as specific issues.

Personal Tutor
--------------

You can contact your Personal Tutor about your individual study either in your timetabled Personal Tutorials or, if needed, via email or a special one-off meeting.

You can also talk to your Personal Tutor if you have an issue that you have raised with a Module Leader but you do not feel has been appropriately addressed.

Senior Tutor
------------

The Senior Tutor usually deals with group feedback (the SSCC or Survey results) but if you have raised an issue with your Personal Tutor and you do not feel it has been appropriately addressed, you may contact the Senior Tutor.

Faculty Senior Tutor
--------------------

The Faculty Senior Tutor has responsibility for ensuring the delivery of consistent, high quality support for students in their personal, general academic and professional development.

If you have a matter which you feel is highly sensitive or complicated you may wish to contact the Faculty Senior Tutor. Engineering’s Faculty Senior Tutor is `Dr Lorraine Craig <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.craig>`_.

Staff-Student Consultative Committee
====================================

The Staff-Student Committee is the formal way for the student representatives to raise issues that are of a concern to the wider student body. Minutes of the meetings are always taken.

This meets termly. Members of the SSCC include all the Student Reps (all Year Reps + School Reps), and representatives from DE staff (Head of School, Director of Undergraduate Studies, and Examination Officer).

Students are strongly encouraged to raise questions or concerns at the Staff and Student Committee though their student representatives.

To find your student representative please see :ref:`student-reps`.

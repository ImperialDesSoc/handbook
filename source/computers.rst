Regular maintenance

You will be responsible for basic laptop upkeep of your laptop. You must arrange:

Students who joined 2015-17: what to do if your School Laptop breaks
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you were issued a School laptop and it breaks, take it to ICT on the first floor of Central Library (opening hours can be seen in `ICT Access`_).

They will take the laptop from you and contact you when it is fixed. If it cannot be fixed, a new one will be provided under the warranty.

School Laptop Library

The Department has 36 laptops that you may borrow for a 4-hours at a time. These laptops are stored in secure lockers that you operate yourself using your Imperial College ID card.

These laptops will be pre-installed with all the relevant software.

The loan laptops are not be taken out of the Dyson building.

Borrowing a laptop is like borrowing a library book. If you do not return it within the due period, **an overdue fine will be incurred.**

  Ensure you allow sufficient time for the turnaround of printing tasks.

Internet Access
===============

Imperial College London provides and supports excellent access to the Internet, both on-site and in halls. However, this access is not unrestricted and its misuse, or its use for anti-social behaviour, are regarded as serious offences.

An account for access to IT facilities was created for you on registration, and you have been provided with a username and password for login and Internet access via Outlook, Internet Explorer and Firefox. If you forget your password and need to obtain a new one, you will need to produce a valid college ID card.

.. important::
  In your contract as a student you have agreed to abide by the Conditions of Use of IT Services. These conditions concern anti-social behaviour by which other users can be affected and areas of misuse which come under UK Law.

  The College network extends to student halls and here, again, it is important to be aware of the restrictions imposed both by College regulations and by national law.

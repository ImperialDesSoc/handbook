Key Dates and Attendance
========================

The College has both a duty of care towards its students, and regulations to ensure that they follow the prescribed programme of studies. For these and other reasons there are a number of points during the year at which your absence will be reported to the Senior Tutor.

Attendance is monitored at:

- Personal tutorials
- Lab/exercise/tutorial sessions
- Workshop assignments
- All coursework submissions are registered.

.. important:: For all coursework submission deadlines, key dates and late-breaking news associated with specific modules, please check the calendar on the corresponding BlackBoard page.

You are required to attend College until the end of session because the External Examiners may wish to interview you during the last week. You should therefore avoid any commitment — other than those forming part of the course — which could prevent you attending College during term-time.

College Email
=============

The email address issued to you on registration will remain active until one year after you leave Imperial.

You can use this address freely to communicate with other students, staff and people outside the College. We try to email you no more than necessary, but messages will still be necessary — and some of these will be very important and, possibly, urgent.

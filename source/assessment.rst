Assessment
==========

Passing the Year
================

The Design Engineering MEng programme consists of four successive, one-year parts. You must pass all of the modules in one year to automatically pass onto the next year.

To pass a module, you must achieve a 40% weighted average for the entire module (so, you could get less than 40% for coursework, but then compensate that with a good exam or vice versa).

Mitigating Circumstances
========================

Circumstances beyond your control may affect your academic performance. This includes anything that means you –

- miss an exam
- miss an assessed presentation
- submit coursework late
- do not do as well on an assessment as you would do otherwise

You are advised to inform the Senior Tutor/ your Personal Tutor of any problems affecting your academic performance as soon as you can.

Submitting a Mitigating Circumstances Form (MC Form)
----------------------------------------------------

If you want the School to take these circumstances into account, you must submit a **MC Form within 5 working days of the assessment date/deadline**.

1. All requests for mitigation should be made on the relevant form:

  a. For major examinations, pieces of coursework and projects, and difficulties impacting upon a substantial part of the academic year, use form marked ‘MAJOR’.

  b. For minor examinations, pieces of coursework and projects, use form marked ‘MINOR’.

  See the next section for guidance on which form to complete. If you are still uncertain which form is appropriate, you should talk to your Personal Tutor.

2. Complete the form with as much detail as you can. Look at the example MC Forms on BlackBoard if you are uncertain about anything. Don’t forget to date and sign the form.

  a. For Major Assessments only – along with your form you need to provide proof of your circumstances. The burden of proof is on you.

3. Return the form and any supporting evidence to the Teaching Office either in-person (Third Floor Dyson Building) or via email (a.marsh@imperial.ac.uk)

.. important:: College policy requires that any details you provide remain confidential as far as possible.

Major or Minor assessment?
--------------------------

The MC Form you submit depends on whether the missed assessment is ‘Major’ or ‘Minor’. The following is a guideline. If you are still uncertain which form is appropriate, you should talk to your Personal Tutor, Senior Tutor, or Director of the Programme.

**Minor Assessments** are equivalent to one ECTS or less are considered minor.

**Major Assessments** are equivalent to more than one ECTS are considered major.

The ECTS credits allocated to **each module** can be found in: Appendix B - Programme Modules Gantt Chart

.. todo:: fix link

You then need to look up what **percentage of the module** your assessment is. This will be in the module handbook, available in the relevant module section of Blackboard.

What happens after I submit the MC Form?
----------------------------------------

**If your request is time sensitive** - For example, if you need permission to miss an exam for a funeral or you need an extension to your coursework deadline – then the mitigating circumstances panel will make a decision as soon as possible. They will reply to you within ten working days of the receipt of all required documentation.

**If your request is NOT time sensitive** - For example, you have already missed your exam or you think your presentation could have been better – then your case will be considered at the termly Mitigating Circumstances Panel.

The Mitigating Circumstances Panel meet threes time a year:

- Second week of T2 (for T1-related cases)
- Second week of T3 (for T2-related cases)
- First week of Summer holidays (for T3-cases)

You will hear the Panel’s decision within five working days of the panel meeting.

.. important:: The College Health Centre can certify illness only for absence from College lasting more than one week, or absence from an Examination. Submit the form as soon as you can.

Mitigating Circumstances forms are in the ‘UG Resources’ section of Blackboard

Getting Your Results
====================

Your results will be loaded onto your eService in early-mid July.

If you are a sponsored student and need your exam results sent to your sponsor, please contact the Student Hub (**Level 3, Sherfield Building**) and they can arrange this for you

When all assessments for the year have been marked and the marks collated, a series of meetings collectively known as the Board of Examiners — review the results and allocate an overall grade to each student.

Generally candidates who do not satisfy the examiners, either in the examinations or after Supplementary Qualifying Tests, will be required to withdraw from the College permanently.

In exceptional circumstances, a student might be allowed to retake the year.

Appeal and Complaints Procedures
================================

We have rigorous regulations in place to ensure assessments are conducted with fairness and consistency.

In the event that you believe that you have grounds for complaint about academic or administrative services, or wish to appeal the outcome of an assessment or final degree, we have laid out clear and consistent procedures through which complaints and appeals can be investigated and considered.

Supplementary Qualifying Tests (resits)
=======================================

In the case of a fail in one or two modules the Board of Examiners may set a Supplementary Qualifying Test (SQT).

This course of action is only available where the performance in on other modules is very good.

You are not guarenteed to be allowed to sit an SQT.

SQTs can take the form of an examination or coursework. The decision on the format is made by the module leader and designed to ensure that the module learning outcomes are achieved.

Students can take a maximum of 2 SQTs per year for the first three years of the course.

No SQTs are allowed in the final year.

SQTs are usually done in the summer (generally early September).

**Any modules that have been passed due to an SQT will be capped to 40%.**

.. important:: SQTs must be taken at Imperial College London. The College cannot make arrangements for them to be taken abroad.

Retaking a Year
===============

Retaking a year that you have failed is only permitted in exceptional circumstances.

The decision on whether or not you will be allowed to retake will be made at the Board of Examiners (in July) or after a failed SQT.

If permission is granted for you to retake a year then you will be expected to start the year again from the start (October) and complete it in full. All of your grades from your previous attempts at that year will be discarded, including any modules that you may have passed. Your grades for any years you successfully passed previously will be unaffected.

Plagiarism
==========

Plagiarism is the presentation of another person’s thoughts, words, images or diagrams as though they were your own.

If any significant level of plagiarism is detected in any submission, the best possible outcome will be a mark of zero.

.. important:: College treats plagiarism and cheating offences very seriously indeed.

Compulsory Lecture
------------------

In the sixth week of term you will hear a lecture on plagiarism by a representative of the College Library. **Attendance at this lecture is compulsory.**
